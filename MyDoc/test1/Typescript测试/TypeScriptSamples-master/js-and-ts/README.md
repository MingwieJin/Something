# TypeScript Sample: Mixing TypeScript and JavaScript

## Overview 

A sample of how to use the `allowJS` option to use both JavaScript and TypeScript together.
A simple text formatter is provided, written in JavaScript. This formatter is then used
within a TypeScript class to format a computation.

To run this sample, you must have `node` installed. You can also use `ts-node` to run this directly
without a compilation from TypeScript to JavaScript.

## Running 

```bash
$ tsc robot.ts`
$ node robot.js`
```
